# AI Agent Instructions for RSSVibe

**Project Context**: RSSVibe is a news aggregation platform that provides personalized content curation using AI algorithms to help users stay informed about topics that matter to them.

## DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE

This is the main reference guide. For specialized topics, see:

- **[Testing Guide](docs/agents/testing-guide.md)** - General testing standards, TUnit patterns, best practices
- **[Integration Testing](docs/agents/integration-testing.md)** - Endpoint testing, test infrastructure, scenarios
- **[Entity Framework](docs/agents/entity-framework.md)** - EF Core patterns, migrations, JSON configuration
- **[Architecture](docs/agents/architecture.md)** - Service layer, project responsibilities, dependency injection
- **[API Design](docs/agents/api-design.md)** - Minimal APIs, hierarchical endpoints, TypedResults
- **[Database](docs/agents/database.md)** - PostgreSQL performance and optimization patterns

---

## GENERAL CODING PRINCIPLES

**Support Level: EXPERT** - Assume advanced knowledge of language idioms and design patterns.

- MUST favor elegant, maintainable solutions over verbose code
- MUST proactively address edge cases, race conditions, and security considerations
- MUST focus comments on 'why' not 'what' (code should be self-documenting)
- SHOULD highlight performance implications and optimization opportunities
- SHOULD frame solutions within broader architectural contexts
- SHOULD provide targeted diagnostic approaches when debugging (not shotgun solutions)
- SHOULD suggest comprehensive testing strategies including mocking, organization, and coverage

---

## GIT & VERSION CONTROL

**Branch Naming**: `feature/{short-description}` or `bugfix/{short-description}`

- MUST use conventional commits for all commit messages
- MUST write commit messages explaining WHY changes were made, not just what
- MUST keep commits focused on single logical changes for easier review and bisection
- Example: `feat: add user preference caching to improve feed load times`

---

## ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORDS (ADR)

**Location**: `/docs/adr/{name}.md`

MUST create ADRs for:
1. Major dependency changes
2. Architectural pattern changes
3. New integration patterns
4. Database schema changes

---

## Querying Microsoft Documentation

You have access to MCP tools called `microsoft_docs_search`, `microsoft_docs_fetch`, and `microsoft_code_sample_search` - these tools allow you to search through and fetch Microsoft's latest official documentation and code samples, and that information might be more detailed or newer than what's in your training data set.

When handling questions around how to work with native Microsoft technologies, such as C#, F#, ASP.NET Core, Microsoft.Extensions, NuGet, Entity Framework, the `dotnet` runtime - please use these tools for research purposes when dealing with specific / narrowly defined questions that may occur.

---

## C# / .NET CODING STANDARDS

**Runtime**: C# 13 on .NET SDK 9.x (see `global.json`)

### Code Style
- MUST keep code warning-free (`TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`)
- MUST use 4 spaces for indentation
- MUST prefer `readonly` and `sealed` where applicable
- MUST follow naming conventions:
  - `PascalCase` for types and methods
  - `camelCase` for locals and parameters
  - `_camelCase` for private fields
- Namespaces MUST match folder and project names
- MUST declare API request/response models as positional records (constructor parameters over property setters) for immutability and clarity
- MUST define FluentValidation validator types as nested classes named `Validator` inside the validated type so they can be referenced via `ValidatedType.Validator`

### Modern C# Patterns (REQUIRED)
```csharp
// Primary constructors
public sealed class Foo(IBar bar) : IFoo

// Collection initializers with spread
opt.OAuthScopes([.. settings.Scopes.Keys]);

// Pattern matching
if (obj is IFoo foo) { /* ... */ }

// Records for immutable data
public record Employee(int Id, string Name);

// Null checks
if (obj is null)
if (obj is not null)
```

---

## BUILD & TEST COMMANDS

```bash
# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Build with warnings as errors (REQUIRED before PRs)
dotnet build -c Release -p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true

# Run tests
dotnet test

# Apply code style from .editorconfig
dotnet format

# Verify formatting (shows unfixable errors)
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
```

## QUICK REFERENCE

| Task | Command/Pattern |
|------|----------------|
| Build for PR | `dotnet build -c Release -p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true` |
| Run tests | `dotnet test` |
| Create migration | `cd src/RSSVibe.Data && bash add_migration.sh MigrationName` |
| Branch naming | `feature/{description}` or `bugfix/{description}` |
| Commit style | Conventional commits explaining WHY |
| Test naming | `EndpointName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior` |
| Test organization | Mirror endpoint structure under `Tests/Endpoints/` |
| Test assertions | `await Assert.That(value).IsEqualTo(expected)` |
| JSON in EF | Create model class + `OwnsOne(x => x.Prop, b => b.ToJson())` |
| Service layer | All business logic in `RSSVibe.Services` project |
| Service pattern | Interface + implementation with command/result types |
| Service visibility | Implementations `internal sealed`, interfaces `public` |
| Service registration | Extension methods `Add{ProjectName}` per project |
| Endpoint returns | MUST use `TypedResults` (NOT `Results` or `IResult`) |
| Endpoint groups | Root: `ApiGroup.MapApiV1()`, Features: `AuthGroup.MapAuthGroup()` |
| Group structure | `/api/v1` → `/auth` → `/register` (hierarchical MapGroup calls) |
